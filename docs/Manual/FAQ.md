# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I use custom isometric sprites?

Yes. If you are looking for custom sprites [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/assets?q=isometric) has published tons of public domain assets and been a great support for the indie community.

## Which target platforms can I use with this asset?

As far as we have tested all of Unity's target platforms are compatible.   
However the target platform must support GPU instancing (i.e.WebGL 2.0, OpenGL es 3.0+ or DirectX 11+).
To read more on this have a look at the [Instancing](/Manual/Instancing/) section.

## How many sprites can I use in a scene?

We unfortunately cannot give a reasonable answer here, because this depends on many other factors.    
We have tested more than 1000 sprites on mid-tier mobile devices, as well as more than 10,000 sprites on desktops.


## Can I combine 3d objects with 2d sprites in my scene?

Unfortunately not. You would most definitely experience sorting artifacts in your scene.
